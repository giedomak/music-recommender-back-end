I feel real black right now
 Real black right now
 I feel real black right now
 Real black right now
 I feel real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 I never knew you like I should've known you
 But my father spoke of you trough that liquor
 Can we get a curtain call
 Let us pray your idea outlives you
 
 'Cause everywhere there is a Chicago
 The only way we're getting out of here is if hit the Lotto
 
 My Mama left the incense burning on the dresser
 A hard way to learn one lesson
 She said never be impressed with
 A man with no message
 
 I feel real black right now
 Real black right now
 I'm feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 And I'll never be Mr. Madiba
 I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 The oppression of a young Malcolm
 The shots rang out across the balcony
 The day we lost a dream
 Too young to sing Marvin Gaye's "Whats going on"
 
 Since then ain't been a lot going on
 Enough pain can a make a whole race bitter
 They say the right amount of love can heal us
 Reminiscing back when Hilfiger made us feel like niggas
 
 And that's the kind of thing that sticks with you
 I never felt this black
 
 I'm feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 I'm feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 And I'll never be Mr. Mediba
 I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 Somebody take us home
 Take me home (Whoa) 
 Baby let's go home (Whoa)
 Let's go home (Whoa)
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 Somebody take us home
 
 You got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
 
 Y'all got me feeling real black right now
 Real black right now
