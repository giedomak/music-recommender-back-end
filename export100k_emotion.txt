Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie? If what we had was real, how could you be fine? Cause Im not fine at all I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didnt need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape Cause Im not fine at all The pictures that you sent me theyre still living in my phone I admit I like to see them, I admit I feel alone All my friends keep asking why Im not around It hurts to know youre happy and to face that youve moved on Its hard to hear your name when I havent seen you in so long Its like we never happened, was it just a lie? If what we had was real, how could you be fine? Cause Im not fine at all I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didnt need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream Id hold you closer than I ever did before And youd never slip away And youd never hear me say I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didnt need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape Im not fine at all

Verse 1 (This is a world premiere) I done been through a whole lot Trial, tribulations, but I know God Satan wanna put me in a bow tie Praying that the holy water don't go dry As I look around me So many motherfuckers wanna down me But ain't no nigga never drown me In front of a dirty doublemirror they found me Hook And I love myself (The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs) I love myself (But it can do what it want whenever it wants and I dont mind) I love myself (He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide) I love myself (One day at a time, sun gon' shine) Verse 2 Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy) What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?) Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving) Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you) Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart On my sleeve, let the runway start You know the miserable do love company What do you want from me and my scars?

These nights never seem to go to plan

'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

Im searching for a song tonight
Im changing all of the stations
I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh baby why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
All the roads you took came back to me
So Im following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause all these strangers come over me
Now I cant get over you
No I just cant get over you

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you

3	I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got it mirrored
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

I'm gonna love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do you how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
Imma make you beg for it, plead for it
Till you feel like you breathe for it
Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
Till it's got you gasping for air And you lean forward
Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me on it
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back, go quick
'Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong?
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong?
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel,
But that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see (see, see, see)

So am I wrong? (am I wrong?)
For thinking that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh)
Now am I wrong? (am I wrong?)
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah)
But that's just how I feel,
That's just how I feel
But that's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see(see, see, see)
1	Uh huh, it's Iggy Iggz
I got one more problem with you girl
Aye

Baby even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
I want you you you
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really want to
I want you you you 

Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
I want you you you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
But it's you you you
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
But it's you you you
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it 
But it's you you you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggz, uh
What you got?
Smart money bettin', I'll be better off without you
In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know
But I really really doubt you
Understand my life is easy
When I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressing
I'm thinking I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back
I finally learned my lesson
No halfstepping
Either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boy
So don't be dumb
I got 99 problems
But you won't be one
Like what

One less, one less problem
One less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya 
I got one less, one less problem
3	I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

1	'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause you light up the path

I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you

'Cause you're a sky, cause you're a sky full of stars
I want to die in your arms, arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm going to give you my heart

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
'Cause in a sky, cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you

Because you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
3	I met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you can swing by my room around ten
Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
Well be in between the sheets till' the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said
She's singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

For a couple of weeks I only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
And those shows have never been what its about
Maybe well go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out
Why I'm sat here singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told you
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to to take him to bed, thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize that you want it
It's a bit too much too late if I'm honest
And all this time God knows I'm singing

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my own
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
1	She sees them walking in a straight line, 
That's not really her style
And they all got the same heartbeat
But hers is falling behind.
Nothing in this world could 
Ever bring them down
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background
And she says

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids

He sees them talking with a big smile
But they haven't got a clue
Yeah, they're living the good life
Can't see what he is going through
They're driving fast cars
But they don't know where they're going
In the fast lane, living life without knowing
And he says

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids

I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids they seem to get it
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
Like the cool kids

And they said
I wish that I could be like the cool kids
'Cause all the cool kids, th
